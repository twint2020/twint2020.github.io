    <p>I’m Ted Wint. At Gold House Ventures in San Francisco—the definitive early stage fund in North America built to back Asian Pacific-led startups—I lead platform initiatives that support our portfolio of founders and amplify GHV’s cultural and strategic impact. As the venture arm of Gold House, GHV invests in and champions Asian Pacific founders shaping the future of culture and commerce.</p>

    <p>Previously, I was a founding member and operations lead at a q-commerce startup, where I launched and scaled a rapidly growing global urban fulfillment network that unlocked new markets for consumer brands across the U.S. and Canada. Before that, I led an operations and strategy team at Winc, a modern winery with a direct connection to the consumer, and before that, I managed operations at Tapcheck Inc., an early-stage FinTech startup. Let’s connect on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tedwint/">LinkedIn</a>.</p>

    <p>I'm active on the Dornsife Alumni Advisory Council as the Strategic Planning Committee Chair and I also serve as a Board Member in the SF Global Shaper Hub for the World Economic Forum. Previously, I led the Marketing Committee on the USC Young Alumni Council and Vice Curatorship at the LA Global Shapers Hub. I’m passionate about the intersection of venture, brand strategy, and the future of consumer. Deeply curious about what drives community, culture, and commerce—especially energized by luxury retail, bold storytelling, and mission-driven founders. Always up for a conversation on startups, consumer trends, or a hit on the tennis court (or the slopes). </p>

    <p>I occasionally write about culture, ideas and other topics I'm interested in. Read about it <a href="https://substack.com/@tedwint?">here</a>.</p>

    <p>I'm a graduate of the University of Southern California with a B.A. in International Relations (Global Business). I was born in Rangoon, Burma, and grew up in the San Francisco Bay Area. </p>
